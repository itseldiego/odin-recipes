Cook the Pasta

Bring a pot of salted water to a boil.
Add fettuccine and cook for 15 minutes or until al dente.
Before draining, reserve 1 cup of pasta water and set aside.
Make the Sauce

In a pan over medium heat, melt 2 tbsp of butter.
Add flour and stir constantly until it turns slightly brown.
Slowly whisk in ½ cup half-and-half and ½ cup heavy cream, stirring until the mixture thickens.
Incorporate Cheese

Lower the heat and add cream cheese and Parmesan cheese.
Stir gently to allow them to melt slowly for a smooth consistency.
Adjust the Sauce

Pour in 1 cup of reserved pasta water to loosen the sauce.
Add paprika, ground black pepper, salt, onion powder, and garlic powder.
Stir well until everything is combined.
Combine & Serve

Add the cooked fettuccine to the sauce, tossing to coat evenly.
Serve immediately and enjoy!
